				Hey! My name is Sean Anih (pronounced Ah-nee), and I'm a web developer
				with a passion for building cloud-based and blockchain applications. I
				love programming, learning and experimenting to help improve my skills.
				Currently, I'm diving deeper into data structures & algorithms and
				exploring ways to integrate AI into applications so that I can help you
				build products that are scalable with a competitive edge. Prior to
				learning web development, I spent 11 years freelancing as an audio
				engineer and 5 years working in the mortgage industry. These experiences
				have given me a unique perspective on problem-solving and project
				management that I bring to my work as a developer. I'm excited to
				continue growing as a developer and helping you meet your business
				needs!
